2020.07 NOW

The repository contains my code for course: Tensorflow in practice.

I use Tensorflow2.1 in my new Hasee computer, which has i5, GTX1660Ti, 512SSD, 16G RAM, costs 5300RMB. My intorducing to Hasee PC is to commemorate the first computer my father bought me in 2012, chich is Asus PC. My Asus PC has been with me for 8 years, both for Undergraduate and Master.

Thanks to [Laurence Moroney](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lmoroney) and [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng). I learned a wonderful Tensorflow course.
